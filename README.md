# ReactiveTwitterSearch

An exploration of implementing an application using ReactiveCocoa 4.0 (Swift) and the MVVM pattern. This accompanies a [blog post](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/05/15/mvvm-reactive-cocoa-3.html) that I wrote regarind ReactiveCocoa 3.0.

In the interests of keeping this project current, it has [recently been updated to use ReactiveCocoa 4.0](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactiveTwitterSearch/pull/9).
